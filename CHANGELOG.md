# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Add dated FXMacroData observations and scheduled releases to regional macro briefs, with optional analyst tools for the public API and MCP operations.

### Changed

- **Cooled dependency refresh (August 2026)** — Move the LangChain, LangGraph,
  Gemini/OpenAI/Anthropic, LangSmith/Langfuse, yfinance, scientific, optional
  OpenTelemetry, and development-tool dependencies to deliberately reviewed
  releases meeting the repository's 14-day routine cooldown. The mypy 2.3
  transitive requirements `ast-serialize` and `librt` are explicitly held at
  cooled versions, and previously unbounded integrations now have major-safe
  ranges.

- **Stronger static-analysis gate** — MyPy now checks function bodies that still lack complete signature annotations; the configured 235-file source gate remains clean without blanket ignores.
- **Evidence provenance** — Deterministic legal and management-guidance preloads have distinct `preflight` provenance, and foreign-language normalization consumes one canonical typed evidence-record contract.

### Fixed

- **Gemini reasoning provenance across adapter versions** — Read the configured
  thinking level through both the legacy `thinking_level` attribute and the
  4.3+ `reasoning_effort` field, while removing the obsolete post-construction
  attribute assignment.

- **ASX screener universe** — Replace the retired listed-companies CSV with the
  current ASX directory feed and remove the obsolete leading-row skip.
- **Kimi K3 cost accounting** — Replace the temporary K2.6 proxy with Kimi's
  published K3 rates for cached input, uncached input, and output tokens.
- **Cryptography timing attack** — Pin `cryptography==50.0.0` to remediate the
  PKCS#7 EnvelopedData decryption finding reported as CVE-2026-69247.
- **Legal-provider failure semantics** — An unavailable Legal Counsel no longer fabricates PFIC/CMIC uncertainty or adds issuer-risk points; it emits one zero-penalty, BUY-blocking coverage flag and leaves legal dimensions unassessed.
- **Malformed legal JSON recovery** — Exact key boundaries prevent prefixed or suffixed decoy fields from being recovered as PFIC, VIE, or CMIC evidence.

### Security

- **h2 and pypdf security findings** — Update `h2` to 4.4.1 after its seven-day
  security cooldown. Update `pypdf` to 6.15.0 as an owner-approved five-day
  exception: Snyk reported excessive-iteration and excessive-memory-allocation
  flaws, and the Auditor parses externally retrieved PDF documents. The latter
  update is intentionally earlier than the normal cooldown because the exposed
  parser path makes the denial-of-service risk material.

## [3.15.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **Provider-neutral LLM seats** — Named application seats now resolve through
  independently configurable base, review, and regional provider planes, with
  validated capabilities, explicit independence waivers, migration tooling, and
  provider-accurate model/tier cost attribution.
- **Retrospective audit tooling** — A read-only evidence/disposition report and
  bounded, archive-aware evaluation make prospective learning coverage and any
  legacy-sweep value observable before prices or lessons are written.

### Changed

- **Evidence-scoped lessons learned** — Retrospectives recover stored bear
  evidence from source artifacts and render deterministic records from an
  explicit disposition policy; only verified, market-contextual outcomes can
  become injectable lessons.
- **Consultant and evidence workflows** — Consultant tools now use bounded
  concurrent batches, while evidence disposition, output validation, and shared
  parser contracts make incomplete evidence explicit rather than inferred.

### Fixed

- **International pricing and portfolio decisions** — Preserve minor-unit
  denominations (including GBp/GBX), compare prices only when currencies and
  scales are compatible, and reject incoherent derived price levels.
- **Runtime resilience and reporting** — Correct flex fallback/cache behavior,
  provider failure classification, optional MCP credentials, degraded-run
  status, and the Auditor/IBKR execution paths.
- **Cross-consumer parser drift** — Centralize repeated report patterns and
  protect key verdict, metric, risk, macro-alert, and ticker parsers with
  regression contracts.

## [3.14.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **Canonical evidence infrastructure** — Registered tool payloads enter through a typed, fail-closed contract before LLM rendering (`src/tooling/evidence_recorder.py`, `src/claim_policy.py`); material claims retain source and period provenance; positive score credits require transitive fact lineage (`src/score_lineage.py`); corrected facts and scores project from one canonical snapshot (`src/analysis_snapshot.py`); and invalid analyses or unapproved articles are retained as diagnostic/draft artifacts rather than silently discarded.
- **Capital-structure evidence checks** — New deterministic checks on capital-structure claims (`src/agents/capital_structure.py`) feeding the Legal Counsel prompt and red-flag detector.
- **Management-guidance & earnings-durability classification** — Deterministic management-guidance retrieval plus an earnings-baseline durability classifier (`TEMPORARILY_BOOSTED`, etc.) that suppresses moat/capital-efficiency bonuses earned on a transient cyclical-peak print.
- **Live-first FX rate cache** — `FxRateCache` (`src/fx_normalization.py`) resolves currency rates live-then-fallback, batched per unique currency per run and cached with a 1-hour TTL, replacing the previous always-fallback path in `src/ibkr/portfolio.py` and `src/ibkr/reconciliation_rules.py`; `FALLBACK_RATES_TO_USD` refreshed to current spot rates.
- **Per-agent/provider/model/tier cost accounting** — Cost rollups by provider, model, and service tier; unpriced-model surfacing; an order-independent pricing matcher (prices `kimi-k3`); retry-cost re-attribution to the originating agent; and a new `scripts/cost_report.py` for ranking spend and diffing baseline-vs-candidate runs.
- **OpenAI-compatible endpoint routing** — `OPENAI_API_BASE` lets the Consultant/Auditor route through OpenAI-compatible providers (e.g. Kimi/Moonshot).

### Changed

- **BUY rationale discipline** — A BUY must cite at least one eligible supporting fact; passing health/growth scores alone no longer establish the forward case.
- **Ownership and evidence provenance** — Further hardening of ownership-structure and MRQ statement-period provenance, with analysis-quality gaps now scored separately from issuer risk instead of being conflated into one penalty.
- **Value Trap Detector** — Thinking level bumped one notch in full mode specifically to reduce fabrication.
- **Gemini model support** — Updated model health checks and pricing for current-generation Gemini models.

### Fixed

- **False rejections from the new evidence gates** — Raw-read `N/A` in guidance validation and rounded-precision citation matches no longer trip false rejections; live-data conflict fast-fails no longer fire on false positives; FLA output budget and FX timeout widened.
- **Forensic-auditor host-rejection observability** — Rejected document hosts are now logged deterministically (previously visible only in the LLM's prose) alongside multi-source issuer-website discovery and raised byte/timeout caps.
- **False `N/A` collapse on `ADJUSTED_*_SCORE`** — `GROWTH_ADJ`/`HEALTH_ADJ` no longer collapse to a false `N/A` when a structurally-unbacked rubric criterion (one that can never be corroborated by design) vetoed an otherwise fully-corroborated scorecard.
- **Article-relative chart paths** — Corrected chart path resolution when generating articles.

## [3.13.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Concentration-aware watchlists** — IBKR recommendations now select BUY-ready watchlist entries and dip adds within configurable exchange and sector limits, account for cash and working orders, protect existing holdings, and keep a safe non-empty watchlist floor.
- **Business-quality decision context** — Investment memos surface code-derived ROIC quality and moat signals, while gate-passing `DO_NOT_INITIATE` outcomes are explicitly marked for review.
- **Bounded forensic evidence** — The Auditor can use approved official disclosures in HTML/text or bounded PDF form, with deterministic freshness, period/scope, currency, and auditor-opinion gates plus shared budget telemetry.

### Changed

- **Safer held-position decisions** — Verdict rejects no longer become automatic sells; exits are confirmation-gated, while entry-constraint and price-weakness cases are routed to review or monitoring to reduce churn.
- **Unified portfolio workflow** — CLI reconciliation and the Flask dashboard now share an action plan and consistent treatment of watchlists, concentration breaches, cash, turnover, freshness, live-order failures, and degraded broker state.
- **Valuation and market-data handling** — Added GPT-5.6 model/pricing support and strengthened multi-exchange position identity, FX normalization, local-price valuation, and portfolio reporting.

### Fixed

- **Forensic and accounting reliability** — Current and audited evidence are kept separate and compared only when periods, scopes, and currencies align; bounded retrieval and explicit insufficiency states prevent unsupported evidence from being treated as clean.
- **Portfolio/report consistency** — Watchlist candidate accounting, action sections, dashboard drilldowns, concentration explanations, and freshness/degraded-state warnings now use the same underlying decisions.

## [3.12.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **APEX Model Tier** — Gate-critical seats (Senior Fundamentals Analyst, Portfolio Manager) are pinnable to a dedicated `APEX_MODEL` with deep-tier thinking, separate from the flash data-gathering tier; in `--quick` they pin to the standard service tier with a larger per-call budget so the block-emitting work finishes before the pipeline watchdog.
- **Flex Service Tiers** — Gemini/OpenAI flex inference at ~50% token price with error-discovered capability caching, standard-tier fallback on capacity/latency, load-bearing timeout floors (quick-mode exempt), and flex/cache-adjusted cost tracking (corrects months of 3–4× cost under-reporting on gemini-3.x/gpt-5.x).
- **Writer Fallback Chain** — The article writer degrades through an ordered Claude → `EDITOR_MODEL` (OpenAI) → Gemini floor chain with truthful `article_writer_fell_back` stamping and family-neutral log events.
- **IBKR Advisory Data Source** — Opt-in (`IBKR_DATA_SOURCE_ENABLED`) sixth merge source supplying point-in-time ratios/price (quality 9.4, overrides Yahoo/FMP, gap-fills the ex-US `trailingPE` vacuum); a no-op that auto-recovers when unentitled.
- **Batch Health Digest** — `scripts/scan_batch_health.py`, auto-run at each stage end of `run_pipeline.sh`, summarizes anomalies (non-publishable, `llm_failures`, consultant `ERROR`/`UNPARSED`, same-mode verdict flips), scoped by file mtime for cross-day-resume robustness.
- **Prompt-Drift Harness** — Tiered L0–L3 prompt↔parser contract tests (`make test-prompts` / `replay` / `eval-semantic`) catching silent prompt/parser format drift at commit time.
- **Score-Consistency & Drawdown Flags** — Deterministic health/growth score validation (`SUSPECT` + arithmetic repair, `*_SCORE_UNRELIABLE` gate guard, per-criterion rubric breakdown audit) and an `UNEXPLAINED_DRAWDOWN_NEWS_GAP` flag with a News-Analyst price-drawdown protocol.

### Changed

- **Portfolio-Manager BUY Discipline** — `VALUATION_INPUT_RELIABILITY` quarantine (distrusted multiples can't back a BUY), suppression of peak/transient moat bonuses, distortion-before-catalyst and material-op-signal BUY blocks, a now-default BUY-stability gate (decoupled from `src.agents` via neutral `pm_decision_parser`), and weak-asymmetry BUY qualification.
- **Consultant/Auditor Wiring** — Verdict scoped to the FINAL CONSULTANT VERDICT section; explicit `MANDATE_BREACH:`/`HARD_STOP:` tokens (prompt v2.12) with negation-aware fallback; a ≤50% partial-tool-failure passes a tagged review rather than discarding it; auditor decoupled from the consultant on the shared OpenAI plane; gate-bypass labeled `SKIPPED` not `UNPARSED`.
- **PM Sizing Reconciliation** — No-initiation verdicts (HOLD/DO_NOT_INITIATE/SELL) clamp both the machine `POSITION_SIZE` token and the human-facing prose to zero, applied after all deterministic verdict modifiers.
- **ex-US Data Quality** — Statement-derived FY revenue/EPS growth overrides stale yfinance scalars (`GROWTH_DATA_STALE`); OCF FILING-authority gated on exact extraction with an independent auditor cross-check; exchange-code canonicalization (TSEJ/TSE/TSXV) with a ground-truth canary.
- **Report Rendering** — Compliance visuals for P/E, health, and growth follow the PM gate verdict; "undiscovered" is softened via a banner caveat; unresolved-auditor stubs render as prose; HOLD memos carry a monitor-only clarifier.

### Fixed

- **Full-Suite pytest Hang** — Memory embedding calls are hard-bounded (google-genai's per-request `timeout=None` disabled all httpx timeouts, hanging an SSL read forever).
- **`--quick` child_timeout Kills** — Flex timeout floors are exempted in quick mode with a standard-tier fallback on queued-flex latency, and APEX seats are pinned standard with a larger budget so gate-critical seats aren't guillotined before emitting their block.
- **DuckDuckGo Fallback Death** — The single-worker search executor is replaced with a constructor-locked multi-worker pool so one hung socket read no longer kills fallback for the rest of the process.
- **Cloudflare 52x** — Consultant transient 520–524 responses are classified retryable instead of dying non-retryable.
- **IBKR Session Lifecycle** — One pooled connection per process with retry on brokerage-session init, watchlist fail-closed, and multi-exchange held-position `conid` resolution.
- **Currency/Valuation** — GAMA.L GBp→GBP double-scale, `format_iv` false cents on KRW/JPY, and scenario intrinsic-value normalization on peak/one-off EPS.

## [3.11.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Korean Equities (KRX/KOSDAQ)** — Enabled end-to-end: config gate, 6-digit yfinance padding, KRW→`.KS` fallback, KSE alias in IBKR↔yfinance translation, and a screener P/E fallback (`marketCap / netIncomeToCommon`) so Korean rows survive yfinance's null `trailingPE`.
- **Brazilian Equities (B3)** — Tickers/exchanges added with BDR filtering at the scraper (round-trip translation preserved) and a pagination fix for `.SA` listings.
- **Special-Situation Exits** — Active tender offers surface as `SPECIAL_SITUATION_EXIT` with a market-vs-tender spread narrative and a PM event-driven override of the hard-fail framework; LOW/MODERATE screen rejects on held positions route to REVIEW (`SCREEN_REJECT`) instead of executable SELLs.
- **Macro-Event Override Rebuild** — Correlated-sell detection now fires on three triggers (14d verdict window, 35% cumulative with stop-breach evidence, refresh-immune price drawdown breadth); demotions are sustained from stored events with rolling expiry; truthful per-trigger flag wording; extensive edge-case regression suite.
- **Ticker-Override Registry & Data-Vacuum Gate** — Operator-curated `config/ticker_overrides.json` for confirmed listing migrations (applied on both analysis and IBKR position sides), `ticker_migration_suspected` logging, and a pre-LLM abort for total-data-vacuum tickers (`--force-data-vacuum` to bypass).
- **Entity Governance Cards** — Canonical entity identity persisted and threaded across prompts, metrics, and serialization.
- **Macro-Regime Threading** — Structured regime context across prompts, persistence, retrospectives, and DIP WATCH scoring.

### Changed

- **Prompt Corpus** — `prompts/*.json` is the single canonical prompt source with fail-loud loading; the stale 3,100-line inline fallback in `src/prompts.py` was removed.
- **Thesis Constants** — Centralized in `src/thesis_constants.py` with prompt↔code parity tests (also corrected stale $500k liquidity documentation to the implemented $100k/$250k policy).
- **Logging Standards** — Six statically-enforced invariants: structlog-only, snake_case events, no f-strings, sanitized exception summaries (`summarize_exception`), redacted content previews, kwargs-only calls; tool/LLM-visible errors are typed, never raw exception prose.
- **PFIC Cross-Check #11** — High cash/asset ratio no longer overrides Legal Counsel; HIGH requires `pfic_status=PROBABLE` or ratio ≥50% with a passive-profile sector.
- **Agent Input Hygiene** — Trader/risk/research prompt assembly reads valid artifacts only, so failure stubs never enter downstream prompts.

### Fixed

- **Cross-Exchange Ticker Matching** — Ambiguous base symbols (e.g. `AGS.SI` vs `AGS.BR`) are poisoned and base-symbol fallback requires currency agreement, ending wrong-exchange analysis attachment.
- **Logger-Level Flattening** — `Settings` construction no longer force-levels every registered logger, which silently destroyed CLI noise suppression (httpx/ibind/genai chatter).
- **Data-Hygiene Repairs** — Deterministic fixes for invalid 52-week ranges, nonsensical ADR routing, and low-P/E anomalies; ADR fields confined to a single canonical DATA_BLOCK source.
- **pm_block Circular Import** — Chart extractors are importable standalone; fresh-subprocess import-order tests guard regressions.
- **Privacy** — Personal portfolio exports untracked and the real IBKR account ID replaced with a synthetic placeholder across docs, scripts, and tests.

## [3.10.1] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Investment Memo Section** — New memo-first report section with bear `KILL_CRITERIA` parser, APAC verdict rubric defaulting to SUPPORT, source-confidence table, and APAC/Auditor PM fallback resolution blocks.
- **Valuation Scenarios** — `VALUATION_SCENARIOS` block with Python-computed bear/base/bull intrinsic values and probability-weighted mean, surfaced in the memo and used as a PM stop-loss anchor.
- **Football-Field Scenario Overlay** — Bear/base/bull/weighted scenario markers on the football-field chart, with compacted labels and a constrained layout to avoid legend/caption overlap.
- **Research Manager Variant Perception** — Variant-aware perception pass with placeholder-variant filtering.
- **Report Quality Judge** — New CLI (`src/eval/report_quality_judge.py`) that resolves rendered markdown via `--markdown-dir` and buckets zero-feature legacy artifacts separately from FAIL.
- **Integration Suite** — 48-test end-to-end suite with fixture builders parameterized across runtime and saved-JSON shapes, exercising all five quality-feature data flows plus strange-input regression guards.

### Changed

- **Saved-State Wiring** — Memo, PM payload, and football-field chart now read saved-JSON shapes, real `DATA_BLOCK` field names, and derived EPS so scenario valuation actually fires in production.
- **PM Summarizer** — Preserves previously worked-out fenced blocks through summarization; auditor fallback gated on named forensic checks rather than a generic "no red flags" string.
- **Auditor/Consultant/Valuation Artifacts** — Persisted alongside other artifacts for downstream consumers.

### Fixed

- **Article Path Resolution** — Article path is now resolved relative to the current working directory rather than the directory where `--output` places its file.
- **Football-Field Layout** — Resolved legend/caption overlap and tightened scenario label rendering.
- **Saved-State Access** — Fixed valuation and source-access paths when reading from saved JSON.
- **Overlay Error Sanitization** — New logging routed through `summarize_exception` to avoid leaking raw tracebacks.

## [3.10.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **APAC Regional Specialist** — Optional no-tools regional audit node after Research Manager, before Consultant. Sends a minimized DeepSeek-compatible payload, lets the agent's silence protocol decide when no material APAC exposure exists (listing, supply chain, customers, regulation, FX, or commodities), and threads the audit into Consultant, Trader, and Portfolio Manager context.
- **Adversarial Prompt-Scanning Corpus** — Added injection-payload corpus, judge-replay fixtures, refresh scripts, and corpus-driven tests for heuristic/LLM-judge inspectors, argument policy, content propagation, and memory-write filtering.
- **MCP Consultant Tooling** — Added MCP runtime/auth/budget/client modules, example server config, smoke script, docs, and consultant-tool integration tests for controlled external tool access.
- **Runtime and Inspection Hardening** — Expanded sanitized logging, prompt-boundary wrapping, tool argument policy checks, escalating/LLM-judge inspectors, runtime service scoping, hard-timeout coverage, and network/circuit-breaker protections.
- **Pipeline Health Tooling** — Added run-health extraction, batch-summary, signal, and slow-tail scripts to make long screening runs easier to diagnose.

### Changed

- **Large Ownership Refactor** — Split the CLI/output/persistence spine, data fetcher, IBKR reconciler, and red-flag validator into smaller ownership modules while preserving public behavior.
- **Metrics and Prompt Adjustments** — Tightened prompt and metric handling around derived metrics, coverage gaps, entity/period mismatches, local coverage, capital allocation, valuation context, and APAC regional review.
- **IBKR and Dashboard Surfaces** — Improved reconciliation ownership modules, portfolio presentation, refresh services, serializers, live dashboard behavior, and security data/quote rescue paths.
- **Dependency and Runtime Updates** — Updated Python dependencies and runtime initialization paths, removed legacy toolkit facades, and kept package roots intentionally lean.
- **README/Test Organization** — Refreshed architecture documentation, example artifact locations, adversarial test documentation, and regression coverage across agents, MCP, tooling, IBKR, validators, scripts, and web surfaces.

### Fixed

- **Prompt-Injection Regression Coverage** — Added corpus floors and replay tests to catch regressions in tool-output inspection, argument policy, content propagation, and memory-write filtering.
- **Runtime Failure Surfaces** — Hardened timeout, network, import-laziness, provider-failure, and sanitized error-reporting paths.
- **Portfolio/Pipeline Edge Cases** — Fixed several screening, cash-summary, interrupted-run, ticker-resolution, and dashboard-refresh edge cases covered by the expanded test suite.

## [3.9.11] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Cached Regional Macro Context** — Added a pre-graph macro analyst so individual equity evaluations can include better regional macro context.
- **Cash-Hoarding Value-Trap Checks** — Enhanced idle-cash and cash-hoarding checks so large cash balances without credible deployment plans are treated as capital-allocation/value-trap risk.

## [3.9.10] - 2026-04-12

### Changed

- **Debugging / Consolidation Pass** — Hardened Langfuse observability, cleaned up runtime and article/editor tracing seams, tightened regression coverage, and improved IBKR portfolio reporting so cash-blocked watchlist candidates are surfaced explicitly instead of disappearing silently.

## [3.9.7] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **Simple Flask UI** — Added a simple Flask-based dashboard UI for IBKR portfolio and analysis review.

## [3.9.6] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- **Prompt Regression Workflow** — Added baseline capture suites, deterministic live prompt checks, and Stage 3 semantic regression checks with an LLM judge under `src/eval/`.

### Changed

- **Shared Default Eval Basket** — `smoke` now uses a globally mixed default basket and both baseline capture and prompt checks run it with no extra arguments.
- **Portfolio / Runtime Cleanup** — Large internal refactor across portfolio-manager, IBKR services, runtime helpers, and supporting tests/docs.

## [3.9.5] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- **Content Inspection Hook** — `src/tooling/inspector.py` / `inspection_service.py` / `inspection_hook.py`: policy layer that potentially sanitises every tool output before it reaches LLM context. `NullInspector` default (zero overhead); swap backend via `configure_content_inspection()` at startup.
- **Per-Agent Output Budgets** — `src/llm_budgets.py` centralises fractional `max_tokens` caps per agent; `src/agents/output_validation.py` coerces and validates DATA_BLOCK numeric fields.

### Fixed

- **`DO NOT INITIATE` Restart Parsing** — `run_pipeline.sh` now correctly recognises `DO NOT INITIATE` verdicts when resuming interrupted batch runs; previously they were re-queued as unresolved.
- **Exchange-Qualified Ticker Propagation** — `src/ticker_policy.py` centralises exchange-suffix rules; fixes cross-exchange base-symbol clashes in the data fetcher and pipeline verdict parser.
- **Trivy CI Pin** — `trivy-action` bumped `0.28.0` → `0.35.0`; the old tag did not exist, silently blocking all Trivy jobs before any scan ran.

### Changed

- **Container Hardening** — `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `scripts/check-environment.sh` updated for Podman-first runtime; `README.md` local-container setup docs expanded.

## [3.9.4] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

- **Internal Hardening / Cleanup Release** — Broad regression-test expansion, efficiency work (especially lazy initialization and runtime overhead reduction), package-level refactoring for clearer ownership, and more consistent IBKR / portfolio-manager reporting. This release is mostly cosmetic and operational rather than feature-driven.

## [3.9.3] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **Consultant C1/C2 Scope** — C1/C2 penalties now apply only to NUMERICAL metric discrepancies. Qualitative governance claims (affiliates, related-party relationships, M&A history) documented in `VALUE_TRAP_BLOCK` (CROSS_HOLDINGS, MAJORITY_HOLDER, M&A_HISTORY) are pre-verified by the Value Trap Detector and must not attract C1/C2 charges (`consultant.json` v2.5).
- **PFIC Asset Test False Pass** — When Cash, STI, or Total Assets are unavailable, the fundamentals analyst now sets `PFIC_ASSET_RATIO = N/A` and writes `QUANTITATIVE_TEST: INSUFFICIENT_DATA` instead of claiming "asset test passed" without a computed ratio (`fundamentals_analyst.json` v9.8).
- **DATA_BLOCK Authority Inversion** — Bull, Bear, and Risky analysts no longer frame DATA_BLOCK figures as "the claim" when a conflicting news/annual figure appears. All three now cite both figures with explicit periods (e.g., "DATA_BLOCK: -33.6% [TTM]; news: -6.7% [FY2024]") and anchor analysis on the DATA_BLOCK value (`bull_researcher.json` v2.7, `bear_researcher.json` v2.9, `risky_analyst.json` v5.3).

## [3.9.2] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **D/E False Positive** — DATA_BLOCK `D/E: 6.92%` was escalated to 692% by the `<10 → ×100` normalisation heuristic after the `%` sign was stripped. Now captures the `%` across all six regex patterns and bypasses the multiplier.
- **UNRELIABLE_PEG False Positive** — PEG < 0.05 penalty suppressed when `revenue_growth_ttm ≥ 50%`; high-growth companies were incorrectly penalised.
- **D/E Scaling (1.5–10 range)** — Edge-case heuristic corrected for ratios in the ambiguous 1.5–10 band.
- **`--skip-scrape` with `--stage 1`** — Flag was silently ignored; now handled correctly.
- **Consultant Derived Metrics** — EV/EBITDA, ROE, and FCF Yield in FINANCIAL HEALTH DETAIL were incorrectly flagged as hallucinated; Derived Metrics Rule added (`consultant.json` v2.3).

### Changed
- **Analyst Hallucination Guardrails** — `NO FABRICATION` added to Bull and Bear KEY INSTRUCTIONS (v2.6/v2.8); `NO NEW NUMBERS` preamble and `PERIOD AWARENESS` note added to Research Manager (v5.1). Agents must write `[figure not in data]` rather than invent figures; 10–30% TTM vs FY divergence documented as normal.
- **Forensic Auditor PERIOD Labeling** — META block now outputs `PERIOD: FY/H1/H2/Q1–Q4`; balance sheet date extracted in fetcher (`auditor.json` v2.6).
- **Consultant COVERAGE_GAP Rule** — Neutral rule broadened from Taiwan/Japan micro-caps to all ex-US markets (`.AX`, `.TO/.V`, `.OL`, `.BR/.AS/.PA/.DE`) (`consultant.json` v2.4).
- **PFIC Detection** — Short-term investments (STI) added to cash definition; balance sheet PFIC fields extracted directly.
- **Stage 1 quick screen** — Now runs in non-strict quick mode; strict thesis enforcement is reserved for Stage 2 full analysis.
- **Taiwanese Equity Gap Handling** — Data gaps no longer treated as integrity failures; construction-sector debt thresholds and extra equity-match checks added.
- **Cross-Day Run Resumption** — Interrupted batch runs can resume mid-ticker-list without reprocessing completed tickers.

## [3.9.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **IBKR Portfolio Integration** - Full support for Interactive Brokers REST API via `ibind`. Includes `IbkrClient` for rate-limited OAuth 1.0a sessions and a `portfolio_manager.py` tool for position-aware reconciliation against AI verdicts.
- **Settled Cash Awareness** - Portfolio logic now distinguishes between total cash and settled (spendable) cash, accounting for T+2 settlement delays in trade recommendations.
- **Automated Portfolio ADD/TRIM** - Reconciler now calculates precise order quantities to scale into underweight positions (ADD) or reduce overweight positions (TRIM) based on target weights.
- **Pipeline Rejection Records** - Stage 1 pipeline rejections (HOLD/DNI) are now stored in the global `lessons_learned` collection. These factual "Negative Evidence" records are injected into future analyses of the same ticker to prevent redundant debate and ensure consistent rejection reasoning.
- **Independent Forensic Channel Visualization** - Updated documentation and Mermaid diagrams to reflect the decoupled data flow from the Forensic Auditor to the External Consultant for independent cross-validation.

### Changed
- **Safety-First Execution** - The `--execute` flag in `portfolio_manager.py` is currently disabled to ensure manual verification of AI recommendations.

## [3.9.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Multi-Horizon Growth Analysis** - Data fetcher now computes three distinct growth horizons from quarterly statements: FY (annual), TTM (trailing twelve months), and MRQ (most recent quarter YoY). Deterministic `growth_trajectory` field (ACCELERATING/STABLE/DECELERATING) added to DATA_BLOCK. Catches deterioration hidden in rearview-mirror annual figures.
- **Retrospective Learning System** (`src/retrospective.py`) - Compares past analysis verdicts to actual market outcomes using excess return vs local benchmark. Generates lessons via Gemini Flash (~$0.001/lesson) and stores them in a global `lessons_learned` ChromaDB collection with geographic boost at retrieval time. Top-3 relevant lessons injected into Bull/Bear researcher prompts on future runs. Eight failure mode taxonomy aligned with Bear pre-mortem analysis.
- **Company Name Verification** (`src/ticker_utils.py`) - Multi-source resolution chain (yfinance → yahooquery → FMP → EODHD) prevents hallucinations when tickers are delisted or ambiguous. Unresolved names inject an explicit warning into all agent system instructions.
- **New Red Flags** - `GROWTH_CLIFF` fires when TTM revenue drops >15%. `THIN_CONSENSUS` fires when total analyst coverage <3, flagging unreliable PEG and target prices.
- **Batch Screening Pipeline** - `scripts/find_gems.py` consolidates scraper and filter into a single two-phase script. `scripts/run_pipeline.sh` orchestrates three-stage screening (scrape → quick analysis → full analysis on BUYs) with resumability and `--force`/`--stage`/`--cooldown` options.
- **Script Tests** - 61 new tests covering `find_gems.py` filters, scraping, CLI parsing, and `run_pipeline.sh` verdict extraction, filename conventions, and resumability logic.

### Changed
- **GICS 11-Sector Alignment** - Red flag detector and fundamentals analyst now use standard GICS taxonomy (Energy, Materials, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Financials, Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, Real Estate) instead of legacy ad-hoc sector names. Three threshold profiles: Financials (D/E disabled), Capital-intensive (D/E >800%), Standard (D/E >500%).
- **English vs Total Analyst Coverage** - `ANALYST_COVERAGE_ENGLISH` (yfinance) now distinguished from `ANALYST_COVERAGE_TOTAL_EST` (supplemented by Foreign Language Analyst's local coverage estimate). Prevents false "undiscovered" signals on stocks with heavy local-language coverage.
- **Test Directory Reorganization** - 86 test files moved from flat `tests/` into 10 domain subdirectories: `agents/`, `memory/`, `validators/`, `charts/`, `reports/`, `financial/`, `config/`, `prompts/`, `advanced/`, `scripts/`. All `pytest` commands continue to work unchanged.

### Removed

## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release Highlights

This release establishes the foundation for a production-grade multi-agent investment analysis system. The architecture demonstrates advanced agentic AI patterns including:

- **State Machine Orchestration** via LangGraph with conditional routing
- **Memory Isolation** using ticker-specific ChromaDB collections
- **Tool Use** with structured schemas and error handling
- **Adversarial Debate** to reduce confirmation bias
- **Deterministic Validation** gates to prevent emotional decision-making

The system is designed for retail investors seeking institutional-quality analysis of international equities without the $24,000/year Bloomberg Terminal cost. It enforces a disciplined GARP strategy while maintaining full transparency of reasoning.

**Performance**: 5-10 minutes per ticker (standard mode), 2-4 minutes (quick mode), negligible cost on free-tier Gemini API.

**Limitations**: Historical data only, free APIs have gaps, backward-looking analysis, manual trade execution required.

**Use Case**: Generate shortlist of candidates for deep due diligence, not for automated trading.
